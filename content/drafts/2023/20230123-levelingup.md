# Leveling Up: The Series

As mentioned in (my bio)[todo:add-link] I've been in software engineering since the second half of 2015, and I broke in through a software development bootcamp. After short stints with a sales-driven company that had drunk its own koolaid and quickly went under, followed by another place that...I'm just not going to talk about... I was recruited to join the office of a recently-acquired startup by one of the world's larger companies.

I thrived, and moved from Software Engineer I to Lead Engineer in four years.

I can attribute my success to a number of factors. I care about people, understanding business workflows, and efficiency. I don't mind sliding into leadership roles, speaking out, or questioning the status quo. And I had leadership that was really passionate about developing people and helping them succeed. Also, I had pretty good technical instincts, even if in the early going, I didn't have very broad or deep technical experience.

## Good Insticts Should Eventually Become Strong Understandings 

The thing is, though, that it's true what they say: The more you advance in software, the less you write software. The more you're leading and impacting, the less you're implementing. Combine that with a run of very large projects at one employer and over my now-six years, I've grown in a lot of ways, but technically I don't have the battle scars and the lessons learned from churning through multiple projects or working in many different stacks across many employers.

I could potentially get that experience by dropping down to a Senior role and jumping around the org (or other orgs), but I'd prefer to try to uplevel my understandings in place through education and exploration. And fortunately, I have an employer who _expects_ me to take some company time to work on professional development.

## Leveling Up - Wherein I teach myself things I didn't know

So I've developed what I call a "dynamic learning plan", that I'm going to experiment with for 2023 to see if it moves me closer to being the T-shaped engineer that I desire to be. 

The idea is to just to make note of subjects that come up at work, or anywhere really, and note when I don't feel like I can speak with confidence - if not authority - on the topic. I'll add those things to my learning list, research them, and then explain what I've learned in blog form to help persist the learnings. And invite discussion from anyone who wants to add context or make a correction, of course.

While I want to be open to this blog eventually covering multiple themes, it will at _least_ contain my list of topics that I am #levelingup on, as that's how I intend to show progress, and maybe, if I'm really fortunate, help someone else level up their understanding as well.
